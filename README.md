Designed and implemented a robust AWS infrastructure aimed at ensuring high availability, scalability, and PCI DSS compliance. The architecture integrates multiple VPCs for redundancy, a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline, and enhanced security measures, making it suitable for handling sensitive payment data.

Key Features:

1. Redundant VPCs: Deployed two VPCs in us-west-1 and us-east-1 for redundancy and high availability, with subnets for web, application, and database layers.

2. Application Load Balancer: Configured ALBs to distribute traffic across application containers in ECS and Fargate.

3. Elastic Container Services (ECS) and Fargate: Utilized ECS and Fargate for scalable, managed containerized applications.

4. CI/CD Pipeline: Integrated Jenkins for CI/CD, automating the release process from code commit to deployment. Managed source code in Git repositories with automated builds and deployments.

5. Security Measures: Implemented AWS WAF to protect against web exploits, AWS GuardDuty for threat detection, and ensured TLS v1.2 for secure communications.

6. Compliance and Monitoring: Designed to meet PCI DSS standards, used Elasticsearch and APM for centralized logging and performance monitoring, and deployed NAT and Internet Gateways for secure traffic management.

7. Scalable Deployment: Leveraged ECS Container Registry for Docker image management and configured auto-scaling policies.

8. Disaster Recovery and Notification: Set up Route 53 for DNS health checks and failover, and implemented notification systems for potential threats and issues.

This architecture combines AWS services to deliver a scalable, redundant, and secure infrastructure, meeting PCI DSS standards for handling sensitive payment data. It ensures high availability, automated deployments, robust security, and compliance, making it ideal for businesses needing a reliable and secure platform.
